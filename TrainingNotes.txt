Hardpoint3:
- Setup:
	- 4xLayouts, 1xRedAgent, 1xBlueAgent
	- Random Start location for agent, random hardpoint visible
	- Raycasts
- Goal:
	- Reach the hardpoint
- Notes:	
	- Agent moved directly to hardpoint when it could be seen by the raycast
	- But was really bad at seeing behind it, and the angle it could see is small, so sometimes it ran past the hardpoint
- Actions to take:
	- put hardpoint tag on backraycast, maybe agent too?
	 - Change obersvation from hardpoint center target to just hardpoint?
